.. rubric:: Overview

The ``ingress-nginx`` application is an installation of `ingress-nginx <https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/>`__ from its `Helm chart <https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx>`__.
We use NGINX as the ingress controller for all Rubin Science Platform deployments rather than native ingress controllers because we use the NGINX ``auth_request`` feature to do authentication and authorization.

NCSA clusters also use the same software, but the NGINX ingress is managed by NCSA rather than via Argo CD.

Upgrading ``ingress-nginx`` is generally painless.
A simple Argo CD sync is sufficient.
